# Oil-Spill-Model
In this repository you can find a numerical model developed for the slick spreading under instantaneous and continuous re-leases through PDE Interface of the COMSOL Multiphysics applying Finite Element Method (FEM).

1) Slick spreading under instantaneous release
2) Slick spreading under continuous release

This model requires COMSOL MultiPhysics 6.0 Coefficient Form PDE module.
